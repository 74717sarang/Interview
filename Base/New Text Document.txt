Top 40 SQL



Here are the Top 40 SQL Interview Questions with Answers for quick interview preparation:

ðŸ”¹ Basics of SQL
What is SQL?
SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to communicate with and manipulate databases.

What is a database?
A database is an organized collection of data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated.

What are the main types of SQL commands?

DDL (Data Definition Language)

DML (Data Manipulation Language)

DCL (Data Control Language)

TCL (Transaction Control Language)

DQL (Data Query Language)

What is the difference between CHAR and VARCHAR2 data types?

CHAR: Fixed-length. Pads with spaces.

VARCHAR2: Variable-length. More efficient for varying-length data.

What is a primary key?
A unique identifier for each record in a table. Cannot contain NULL values.

What is a foreign key?
A field in one table that refers to the primary key in another table. Used to maintain referential integrity.

What is the purpose of the DEFAULT constraint?
Sets a default value for a column if no value is specified.

ðŸ”¹ Database Design & Normalization
What is normalization in databases?
The process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.

What is denormalization, and when is it used?
Combining tables to improve read performance, often used in reporting or OLAP systems.

ðŸ”¹ SQL Queries & Functions
What is a query in SQL?
A request to perform operations like retrieval, insertion, or updating data in a database.

What are the different operators available in SQL?

Arithmetic: +, -, *, /

Comparison: =, <, >, <=, >=, !=

Logical: AND, OR, NOT

Special: IN, BETWEEN, LIKE, IS NULL

What is a view in SQL?
A virtual table based on the result of a SQL query.

ðŸ”¹ Constraints & Joins
What is the purpose of the UNIQUE constraint?
Ensures that all values in a column are different.

What are the different types of joins in SQL?

INNER JOIN

LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)

RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)

FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN)

CROSS JOIN

SELF JOIN

What is the difference between INNER JOIN and OUTER JOIN?

INNER JOIN: Returns matching rows.

OUTER JOIN: Returns matching + non-matching rows from one or both tables.

ðŸ”¹ Aggregations & Subqueries
What is the purpose of the GROUP BY clause?
Groups rows with the same values for aggregate functions like SUM, AVG, etc.

What are aggregate functions in SQL?
Functions that perform calculations on a set of values: SUM(), AVG(), COUNT(), MAX(), MIN().

What is a subquery?
A query nested within another SQL query.

ðŸ”¹ Filtering & Indexing
What is the difference between the WHERE and HAVING clauses?

WHERE: Filters rows before grouping.

HAVING: Filters groups after aggregation.

What are indexes, and why are they used?
Data structures that improve query performance by speeding up data retrieval.

ðŸ”¹ Data Manipulation & Optimization
What is the difference between DELETE and TRUNCATE commands?

DELETE: Removes rows one by one, can use WHERE.

TRUNCATE: Removes all rows quickly, cannot use WHERE.

What is the purpose of the SQL ORDER BY clause?
Sorts the result set based on one or more columns in ascending or descending order.

ðŸ”¹ SQL vs NoSQL
What are the differences between SQL and NoSQL databases?

SQL: Relational, structured schema, uses SQL.

NoSQL: Non-relational, flexible schema, suitable for unstructured data.

ðŸ”¹ Database Objects & Constraints
What is a table in SQL?
A collection of rows and columns used to store data.

What are the types of constraints in SQL?
NOT NULL, UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, CHECK, DEFAULT

What is a cursor in SQL?
A database object used to retrieve and manipulate data row-by-row.

What is a trigger in SQL?
A set of instructions that automatically executes in response to certain events on a table.

ðŸ”¹ SQL Statements
What is the purpose of the SQL SELECT statement?
Retrieves data from a database.

What are NULL values in SQL?
Represent missing or unknown data.

What is a stored procedure?
A precompiled collection of SQL statements stored in the database and executed as a program.

ðŸ”¹ DDL & DML Commands
What is the difference between DDL and DML commands?

DDL: Defines structure (CREATE, ALTER, DROP)

DML: Manipulates data (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)

What is the purpose of the ALTER command in SQL?
Modifies existing database objects like tables (add, delete, or modify columns).

ðŸ”¹ Advanced SQL Concepts
What is a composite primary key?
A primary key made of two or more columns.

How is data integrity maintained in SQL databases?
Through constraints (PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, etc.).

What are the advantages of using stored procedures?

Reusability

Improved performance

Centralized business logic

Reduced client-server traffic

ðŸ”¹ Set Operations & Case Handling
What is a UNION operation, and how is it used?
Combines results of two queries, removes duplicates.

What is the difference between UNION and UNION ALL?

UNION: Removes duplicates.

UNION ALL: Keeps duplicates.

How does the CASE statement work in SQL?
Provides if-then-else logic within SQL queries.

ðŸ”¹ Functions & Special Operations
What are scalar functions in SQL?
Functions that return a single value: UCASE(), LCASE(), NOW(), LEN(), ROUND().

What is the purpose of the COALESCE function?
Returns the first non-null value in a list of expressions.
