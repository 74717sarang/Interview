Hi [HR's Name],
I hope you're doing well. I recently completed my PG-DAC with a focus on Full Stack Development using Java, Spring Boot, and .NET technologies. I’ve built projects using React.js, REST APIs, and MySQL, and I’m now looking for entry-level opportunities to apply these skills.

If there are any openings or recommendations, I’d be grateful to connect and hear from you.

Thank you!
Sarang Patil
